```ts title="lib/utils.ts"
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';
import { ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

Streamline class name management for Tailwind CSS with this exported function `cn`. Simply pass in one or more class names, either as a string, array of strings, or an object, and the function will merge them into a single, optimized string for use with your HTML/JSX elements. The [`clsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) utility concatenates the class names, while the `twMerge` from the [`tailwind-merge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) library optimizes the final output for maximum efficiency. Make class name management a breeze with this simple and convenient solution.
