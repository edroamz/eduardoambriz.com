```ts title="lib/utils.ts"
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';
import { ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

This code exports a function `cn` that merges Tailwind CSS class names. The function takes one or more arguments, which are passed to the [`clsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) utility. `clsx` concatenates the class names and returns a string of space-separated class names. The resulting string is then passed to the `twMerge` function from the [`tailwind-merge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) library. `twMerge` merges the Tailwind CSS class names into a single string.

The `...inputs: ClassValue[]` syntax allows the function to accept an indefinite number of arguments of the `ClassValue` type. The `clsx` function accepts one or more arguments, which can be either a string, an array of strings, or an object that maps class names to boolean values. The `twMerge` function accepts a single string argument, which is a space-separated list of class names.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to build up class names for HTML/JSX elements, and makes it easy to use Tailwind CSS with multiple configuration files.

## Formatting and linting

- [`eslint-plugin-tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss) - Plugin for ESLint that checks your code for best practices and common errors when using Tailwind CSS.

- [`prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) - Plugin for Prettier. It formats your code according to a set of rules and conventions, ensuring that your code is consistent and readable.

By using these packages, you can ensure that your code is **consistent**, **error-free**, and **easily readable**, making it easier to maintain and collaborate on your projects.
