```ts
type WithRequired<T, K extends keyof T> = T & { [P in K]-?: T[P] };
```

TypeScript utility type that creates a new type from the type `T` with the properties in `K` made required. The `WithRequired` type is the intersection of `T` and an object type that has a property for each property in `K` with a type of the corresponding property in `T` and a required modifier (`-?`).
